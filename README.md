   ```

## Usage

### Initialization

Start by initializing the Cocomp virtual machine:

```c
Cocomp cocomp;
initialize_cocomp(&cocomp);
```

This sets up the memory, stack, heap, and neural network parameters.

### Memory Management

**Print Memory**

To view the contents of the memory and heap:

```c
print_memory(&cocomp);
```

**Push to Stack**

Push a value onto the stack:

```c
push_stack(&cocomp, 3.14);
```

**Pop from Stack**

Retrieve a value from the stack:

```c
double value = pop_stack(&cocomp);
printf("Popped value: %lf\n", value);
```

**Heap Allocation**

Allocate and free memory in the heap:

```c
allocate_heap(&cocomp, 10);  // Allocate 10 blocks
free_heap(&cocomp, cocomp.heap_pointer, 10);  // Free the allocated blocks
```

### Paging System

**Simulate Page Fault**

Simulate a page fault to test the paging system:

```c
simulate_page_fault(&cocomp, 128);
```

### Process and Thread Management

**Process Management**

Manage multiple processes:

```c
process_management(&cocomp, 5);  // Manage 5 processes
```

**Thread Management**

Manage threads and their stack pointers:

```c
thread_management(&cocomp, 3);  // Manage 3 threads
```

### Neural Network

**Initialize Neural Network**

Initialize the neural network parameters:

```c
initialize_neural_network(&cocomp);
```

**Train Neural Network**

Train the neural network with sample inputs and targets:

```c
double inputs[INPUT_LAYER_SIZE] = {0.0};  // Example inputs
double targets[OUTPUT_LAYER_SIZE] = {0.0};  // Example targets
train_neural_network(&cocomp, inputs, targets, 1, 10);  // 1 sample, 10 epochs
```

**Forward Pass**

Perform a forward pass through the network:

```c
forward_pass(&cocomp);
```

**Backward Pass**

Perform a backward pass for learning:

```c
double target_output[OUTPUT_LAYER_SIZE] = {0.0};  // Example target outputs
backward_pass(&cocomp, target_output);
```

### Dynamic Code Loading

**Load Dynamic Code**

Load and execute dynamic code segments:

```c
unsigned char code[] = { /* dynamic code bytes */ };
load_dynamic_code(&cocomp, code, sizeof(code));
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Memory Operations

```c
Cocomp cocomp;
initialize_cocomp(&cocomp);
push_stack(&cocomp, 5.0);
double popped_value = pop_stack(&cocomp);
printf("Popped value: %lf\n", popped_value);
print_memory(&cocomp);
```

### Example 2: Neural Network Training

```c
Cocomp cocomp;
initialize_cocomp(&cocomp);
double inputs[INPUT_LAYER_SIZE] = {1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0};
double targets[OUTPUT_LAYER_SIZE] = {0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0};
train_neural_network(&cocomp, inputs, targets, 1, 10);
```

### Example 3: Process and Thread Management

```c
Cocomp cocomp;
initialize_cocomp(&cocomp);
process_management(&cocomp, 3);
thread_management(&cocomp, 2);
```

## Advanced Topics

### Paging System

The paging system simulates how virtual memory is managed. The `INVALID_PAGE` constant (`0xFF`) represents pages that are not currently loaded. The `simulate_page_fault` function can be used to test the handling of page faults and replacement policies.

### Neural Network

The neural network in Cocomp is a simple feedforward network with one hidden layer. It supports basic operations like forward pass, backward pass, and training with backpropagation.

### Dynamic Code Loading

The dynamic code area allows for the simulation of loading and running dynamic code segments. This can be used for educational purposes to demonstrate code execution and memory management.

## Troubleshooting

- **Warnings or Errors**: Ensure that the `INVALID_PAGE` constant is set correctly and that comparisons are made against valid `unsigned char` values.
- **Memory Issues**: If you encounter stack overflow or heap allocation errors, adjust the sizes of the stack and heap or review the allocation logic.

## Conclusion

Cocomp is a versatile tool for understanding computer architecture, memory management, and neural networks. By following the instructions and examples provided, you can explore and experiment with various aspects of virtual machine simulation and machine learning.

## Create more advanced `cocomp`

---
Create a more advanced version of `Cocomp`, a virtual machine with integrated neural network capabilities, involves designing and implementing several features. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to help you build and expand `Cocomp` effectively:

### 1. **Define the Project Scope**

Before diving into the code, outline the features and functionalities you want to include. For an advanced `Cocomp`, consider these:

- **Memory Management**: Stack, heap, and paging
- **Process and Thread Management**: Handling multiple processes and threads
- **Dynamic Code Execution**: Loading and executing dynamic code
- **Neural Network**: Implementing and training a neural network
- **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**: Sending and receiving messages between processes

### 2. **Set Up Your Development Environment**

Ensure you have a C compiler installed (e.g., GCC) and set up a development environment. For cross-platform development, tools like CMake can be helpful.

### 3. **Implement Basic Components**

#### a. **Memory Management**

- **Stack and Heap**: Implement functions to manage stack operations (push/pop) and heap allocation/freeing.
  
  ```c
  #define STACK_SIZE 1024
  #define HEAP_SIZE 1024

  typedef struct {
      double stack[STACK_SIZE];
      int stack_pointer;
      unsigned char heap[HEAP_SIZE];
      int heap_pointer;
  } Cocomp;

  void push_stack(Cocomp *cocomp, double value);
  double pop_stack(Cocomp *cocomp);
  void allocate_heap(Cocomp *cocomp, int size);
  void free_heap(Cocomp *cocomp, int address, int size);
  ```

  ```c
  #define NUM_PAGES 256
  #define PAGE_SIZE 16
  #define INVALID_PAGE 0xFF

  typedef struct {
      unsigned char page_table[NUM_PAGES];
  } Cocomp;

  void simulate_page_fault(Cocomp *cocomp, int page_number);
  ```

  typedef struct {
      unsigned char dynamic_code_area[DYNAMIC_CODE_SIZE];
  } Cocomp;

  void load_dynamic_code(Cocomp *cocomp, unsigned char *code, int size);
  ```

### 4. **Implement the Neural Network**

#### a. **Define Neural Network Components**

  void train_neural_network(Cocomp *cocomp, double *inputs, double *targets, int num_samples, int epochs);
  ```

### 5. **Develop Main Functionality**

Integrate all components into the main function:

```c
int main() {
    Cocomp cocomp;
    initialize_cocomp(&cocomp);

    // Memory operations
    print_memory(&cocomp);
    push_stack(&cocomp, 3.14);
    printf("Popped value: %lf\n", pop_stack(&cocomp));
    allocate_heap(&cocomp, 10);
    free_heap(&cocomp, cocomp.heap_pointer, 10);

    // Paging and process management
    simulate_page_fault(&cocomp, 128);
    process_management(&cocomp, 5);
    thread_management(&cocomp, 3);

    // Neural network operations
    initialize_neural_network(&cocomp);
    double inputs[INPUT_LAYER_SIZE] = {0.0};
    double targets[OUTPUT_LAYER_SIZE] = {0.0};
    train_neural_network(&cocomp, inputs, targets, 1, 10);

    return 0;
}
```

### 6. **Testing and Debugging**

Thoroughly test each component and feature. Use print statements or a debugger to troubleshoot issues.
